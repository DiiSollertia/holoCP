>To those coming from r/all:  
>Hello! Welcome to the official subreddit for hololive production (wikipedia), a talent agency based out of Tokyo, Japan 
>that manages Virtual YouTubers - think of streamers on Twitch and YouTube, but with virtual avatars instead of a facecam. 
>Most of the talents in Hololive are Japanese, but there are also Indonesian and English branches too! The talents do all sorts of stuff, including but not limited to: gaming streams, karaoke streams, drawing streams and talking streams. 
>Some of the content the talents offer is family friendly, others a bit more risque. The sidebar has links to each talent's Youtube and Twitter accounts.

- `!fbkglasses`
>Glasses are really versatile. First, you can have glasses-wearing girls take them off and suddenly become beautiful, or have girls wearing glasses flashing those cute grins, or have girls stealing the protagonist's glasses and putting them on like, "Haha, got your glasses!" 
>That's just way too cute! Also, boys with glasses! I really like when their glasses have that suspicious looking gleam, and it's amazing how it can look really cool or just be a joke. 
>I really like how it can fulfill all those abstract needs. Being able to switch up the styles and colors of glasses based on your mood is a lot of fun too! It's actually so much fun! 
>You have those half rim glasses, or the thick frame glasses, everything! It's like you're enjoying all these kinds of glasses at a buffet. 
>I really want Luna to try some on or Marine to try some on to replace her eyepatch. We really need glasses to become a thing in hololive and start selling them for HoloComi. 
>Don't. You. Think. We. Really. Need. To. Officially. Give. Everyone. Glasses?

- `!guracars`
>Hello, ma'am do you have a minute to talk about our lord and savior Lightning McQueen?!
>Did you know that Lightning McQueen is the star of several feature films such as Cars, Cars 2, Cars 3, Planes: Fire and Rescue, Finding Dory, Toy Story 3, Coco and Ralph breaks the internet? 
>As well as other short film such as Master and the Ghostlight, Miss Fritter's Racing Skoool, Television program such as Cars Toons, Pixar's Popcorn Cars series voiced by none other than Owen Wilson?
